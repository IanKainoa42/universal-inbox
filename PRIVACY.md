# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023

## Overview

Universal Inbox is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe that your thoughts and notes are personal and should remain that way.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Storage
All items captured in Universal Inbox are currently stored locally on your device. We use `UserDefaults` for storage in this early version, with plans to migrate to encrypted storage (e.g., Core Data or SwiftData) for enhanced security.

### API Keys
If you choose to use AI features, your OpenAI API Key is stored securely in the device's Keychain. It is never transmitted to our servers or any third party other than OpenAI (when processing your request).

### Cloud Sync
When CloudKit integration is enabled (future feature), your data will be stored in your private iCloud database. We do not have access to your data.

## Data Usage

### AI Processing
When you use AI features to process your notes:
- The content of your note is sent to the AI provider (e.g., OpenAI).
- Your API Key is used to authenticate the request.
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the AI provider you use.
- We do not send any additional Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the AI provider.

## Tracking

Universal Inbox does not track your usage or collect any analytics data. We do not use any third-party tracking SDKs.
