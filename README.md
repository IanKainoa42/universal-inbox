# Universal Inbox

Capture anything, AI routes it to the right place.

## What is this?

Universal Inbox separates the act of capturing thoughts from organizing them. Dump anything into a single "scratch note" inbox, then batch-process with AI that classifies and routes each item to user-defined bins.

**Not another note app** - it's a capture + routing layer that works WITH your existing tools.

## Core Concept

```
Write anything → Close app → AI parses & classifies → Items disappear into bins
```

- **Capture**: < 5 seconds to dump thoughts and close
- **Process**: Automatic on close/idle - no button to press
- **Route**: AI categorizes based on YOUR defined bins, items fade away as they're routed
- **Next open**: Clean slate
