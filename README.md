# Universal Inbox

Capture anything, AI routes it to the right place.

## What is this?

Universal Inbox separates the act of capturing thoughts from organizing them. Dump anything into a single "scratch note" inbox, then batch-process with AI that classifies and routes each item to user-defined bins.

**Not another note app** - it's a capture + routing layer that works WITH your existing tools.

## Core Concept

```
Capture (fast) → Inbox pile → "Process" button → AI classifies → Routes to bins
```

- **Capture**: < 5 seconds to dump a thought and close
- **Process**: Batch, not real-time. You control when.
- **Route**: AI categorizes based on YOUR defined bins, removes items as they're routed
